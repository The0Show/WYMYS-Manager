# Will You Mod Your Snail Plan

Hello! This is a quick write up on the plan for Will You Mod Your Snail (WYMYS). For context, Will You Mod Your Snail is a mod loader for Will You Snail. People have been asking how it'll work, so I decided to write this. Not because I don't want to answer, but because I want to make sure everyone gets the same information from a place that can be updated at any time!

## General Plan

WYMYS accepts `.wysmod` and `.bps` files. `.bps` files will be copied with their own created manifest. `.wysmod` files are formatted as ZIP files, with the `.bps` file and `mod.json` in the root. WYMYS will patch the game for the user.

## Developers

WYMYS makes it easy for mod developers to create `.wysmod` files in the same program. It can also handle creating the `.bps` patch for you. If you don't want to create `.wysmod` files, you can just distribute the `.bps` patch, WYMYS will accept them and handle them correctly.
